Source Code Analysis
====================

Utilities to analyze, lint and rewrite source code in various languages.

Typically uses regular expressions to grok source code, and is therefore heuristic and reliant on
basic style conventions, to some degree.  Nonetheless these have proven to be very useful in practice.

Work in progress. 

See comments in code for details, and on how to run.

Use this to run tests (After installing pytest):

PYTHONPATH=src/python/ py.test test/python/

TODO: Document.
